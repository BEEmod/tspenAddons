        <h1>New Items</h1>

		<h2 id="new">New Elements</h2>
		<p>This category contains totally new items, either ones available through the Authoring Tools but not in the PTI or custom test elements made by others.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Worldportals (two items):</dt>
		<dd>A worldportal packaged up into an exit/entry door. Wire ONE entry door to ONE exit door. For the entry door, inputs and the start enabled property work like normal, 
			except they also affect the other door. 
			For the exit door:<ul>
			<li>Weighted is an exit door.</li>
			<li>Cube is a exit door with a fizzler inside.</li>
			<li>Sphere is a door with a fizzler that auto-closes and locks itself when walked through.</li>
			</ul></dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Sphere Cannon Dropper:<dt>
		<dd>The Sphere Cannon, modified to spawn from a cube dropper. Original made by PortalCombat.<br >
			<ul class="buttons">
				<li>
				<a class="button arr-down" href="http://forums.thinking.withportals.com/downloads.php?view=detail&amp;df_id=2728">Sphere Cannon</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		<dl>
		<dt>Futbol:</dt>
		<dd>A reimplementation of the cut testing element, Futbols are small glass spheres held in receptacles. Upon contact with any surface they instantly break. They appear in one receptacle and can be taken to others to power them. Auto-drop controls whether this receptacle starts with a futbol, and auto-respawn controls whether this will automatically respawn the futbol. Inputs to this item work like cube-droppers; the output activates when a futbol is inside. High Energy Pellets, Thermal Discouragement Beams, Turret fire and Emancipation Grills will destroy futbols. Excursion funnels can carry them safely.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Conveyor Belt:</dt>
		<dd>A continuous belt moving from one end of the track to the other. The first and last sections of belt track are covered. 
			Setting it to reversed will increase the speed, preventing the player from overpowering it without Propulsion Gel. Auto-drop = Start enabled on this item.
			The conveyor surface is positioned one block above the surface it is placed on. Oscillating mode will make only one belt segment appear. 
			No longer paintable, due to some resultant bugs. Use the legacy version if you want a printable one, but this is very buggy and not fully styled for all styles.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Wheatley Monitor:</dt>
		<dd>A Wheatley monitor. This item shows the current controller of the Enrichment Center. All monitors will be damaged if the player or objects impact the glass. <br >
			Clean Style uses a standard monitor which shows GLaDOS. Turrets will not fire at her.<br >
			Portal 1 Style uses two stacked observation rooms.<br >
			Old Aperture Style uses Cave portraits, matching the decade. <br >
			Ratman Style uses a shattered, sparking monitor showing only static. <br >
			Art Therapy is the same as Clean style.<br>
			<!-- Unreleased:
			Wheatley Style will use monitors showing Wheatley himself. Turrets will fire at him. <br >
			BTS Style will use a few computer towers protected by a cage. </dd>
			--></dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>	
		<dt>Turret Dropper:</dt>
		<dd>A turret dispenser. This will drop a boxed turret which unboxes itself (so it doesn't fall over immediately). It lands on a small pad 2 blocks below the dropper. Try not to let the player mess with the falling box. Unfortunately I can't detect turrets being fizzled so that won't cause a respawn.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>		
		<dt>Toggleable Faith Plate:</dt>
		<dd>A faith plate that can be turned on and off. When off, it will not fire. An orange light indicates the plate is disabled. Old Aperture styled versions clean and re-dispense the gel when triggered. This is purely visual, no cubes or panels can be painted by this.</dd>
		</dl>
			
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Coop Checkpoint:</dt>
		<dd>A checkpoint room which will make players respawn there after they have walked through it. It is a one-way path and requires both players inside before the door in front will unlock as the doors behind close. The entry door will accept inputs to open/close it. Once any player enters the room, the entry door will lock open until both are inside. This is useful when having chambers with multiple rooms. The chamber also has a fizzler to keep the two sides of the chamber separated. Old Aperture style has two pedestal buttons that must be pressed rapidly to force both players to be inside; the door will only open when both players are inside and the buttons have been pushed, to prevent fast players from activating this. <br >
			The space in front of the two doors must be empty.<br >
			The door will also unlock when a player enters if the level is single-player only, for ease of playtesting.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Separated Coop Checkpoint:</dt>
		<dd>A variant of the normal checkpoint, this separates the coop players into two rooms as well as setting their spawn point. The buttons inside allow players to choose which side they go to. The item takes up a 4 deep, 5 high and 5 wide area. The entry door takes up two blocks, but is centred on three. The two exit doors are on either side of the centre of the item. This centre section can be occupied by walls or other objects.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>BumbleBall Droppers, Catapult Cube Droppers, Bomb Dropper:</dt>
		<dd>A cube dropper which dispenses bombs (weighted), BumbleBalls (sphere) or Catapult Cubes (cube). 
		<p>Auto-respawn and auto-drop options work like the normal dropper. Catapult Cubes have a small Aerial Faith Plate on one side and were made by Skotty and Soundlogic. When a player or objects touches this, they will be thrown away from the cube. The cube is affected by gels, but this is not visible. Catapult Cubes will activate buttons like other cubes. When placed to face upwards, they will throw the player 2 blocks into the air. Old-Aperture themed versions are a regular cube painted with repulsion gel on one side. When held, these allow the player to rotate them by holding the secondary fire button and moving the mouse.</p>
		<p>Bumbleballs are large balls raised on spikes which hop around whenever players are not looking at them. They are not affected by gels, but they will be painted. The ball will still hop around if players look at it through portals. They only activate special BumbleBall buttons. BumbleBalls were created by Skotty and Moth. If the BumbleBall is dropped in goo it may not respawn correctly, so always add a respawn pedestal button if required.</p>
		<p>The bomb dropper appears as an exposed vacuum tube and drops bombs once a second when enabled. The input is inverted if the auto-drop option is selected. Bombs will be thrown by faith plates. The auto-respawn property does not affect this. Bombs can be safely caught by funnels and will be thrown by Faith Plates, in a similar manner to paint bombs. They can be painted, but very few circumstances exist where this will be useful.</p>
		<p>BumbleBalls and Catapult Cubes (but not the Old Aperture Catapult Cube) are custom models, which will be packed into your map automatically.</p>
		<p>
			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a class="button arr-down" href="http://forums.thinking.withportals.com/downloads.php?view=detail&amp;df_id=1418">Catapult Cubes</a></li>
				<li><a class="button arr-down" href="http://forums.thinking.withportals.com/downloads.php?view=detail&amp;df_id=1377">BumbleBalls</a></li>
		   </ul
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Bumbleball Button:</dt>
		<dd>A special button which is activated by BumbleBalls only. It appears like the normal sphere button. Old Aperture uses grated buttons like spheres, but with a star-shaped hole. When the BumbleBall is on the button it will not move by itself.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr>
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Cube Transmuter:</dt>
		<dd>Converts a cube to a different type when placed inside. Only works on one at a time. When cubes dissolve it will re-dispense as the original type from the original dropper. The companion cube sign material was made by Skotty and this item was suggested by Unowninator.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr>
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Timeout Portals:</dt>
		<dd>This modifies the player`s portals so they destroy themselves after a set amount of time. Only ever place one of each type into the map. If set to infinite portals will fizzle after they teleport the player, cubes, turrets or paint bombs. This item does not affect portals generated by AutoPortal emitters. Weighted is for Singleplayer, Cube is for ATLAS and Sphere is for P-Body.</dd>

		<dl>
		<dt>Neurotoxin</dt>
		<dd>Introduce a time limit to test chambers. Every second on the counter property corresponds to 30 seconds (15 = 7:30). Setting it to infinite will make the timer last one minute. Inputs will start the neurotoxin or stop and reset the timer. The timer will only ever start after the player enters the map. The vent item dispenses neurotoxin in the nearby area. It is automatically controlled by any timers in the map. In preview mode indicator dots will appear to show the area of effect. These will not show up when published. 
			<p>In Coop mode the map will restart after the neurotoxin is released, as players will not be able to shut it off. I don't recommend you use this in coop maps though since robots shouldn't be affected by poisons.</p>
		</dd>

		<!-- - - - MODIFIED - - - -->
		<h2 id="modified">Modified Standard Items</h2>
		<p>Currently available items rearranged or combined together in ways not normally possible, or more elegantly.</p>
		<dl>
		
		<dt>Retractable Pedestal Button:</dt>
		<dd>This pedestal button accepts an input which will raise it up from under the floor. It cannot be pushed when not fully up. The Old Aperture styled version of this uses a normal button, modified to display a checkmark sign and not function without the input signal.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Diagonal Pellet/Laser:<dt>
			<dd>A laser or pellet emitter on a triangular block which makes it aim diagonally. These do work with the Sendificator.
				<ul>
					<li>Weighted is a pellet emitter.</li>
					<li>Cube is a centred laser.</li>
					<li>Sphere is a laser offset to the floor.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Large Faith Plate:</dt>
			<dd>A set of three faith plates. They only animate straight upward, and are usually used on walls or when firing directly upward. This item can also be turned on/off, which will prevent the catapult from firing. It appears the same as the regular faith plate in Old Aperture Style.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Cube Cleaner:</dt>
			<dd>A small hole in the wall with a water fountain to clean cubes.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>		
		<dt>Double Grated Panel:</dt>
			<dd>A set of grating-topped panel arms that unfold in sequence. Chain these together using the in/outputs to extend the effect. Start Reversed reverses the movement order.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Caged Turret, Cube: </dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>Weighted = A turret in a cage which prevents the turret from being tipped over. Thy can still be destroyed by lasers. </li>
			<li>Cube = A reflector cube inside a cage to stop it from being moved.</li>
			<li>Sphere = A reflector cube in a higher up cage to let it interact with centre-positioned lasers. </li>
		</ul>
			Lasers will pass through the frame of all types, to help with aiming.
		</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Global Item Dropper:</dt>
		<dd>A special cube dropper which respawns any dropper-less cube. The input will enable this dropper and disable any other global droppers. Don't set two to start enabled or connect two to the same thing; this will cause the cube to be duplicated. Use this in maps with multiple rooms and to allow cubes to always respawn close to the player and not in inaccessible rooms. It can take some time to replace all cubes if many are destroyed at once. The dropper will replace:<ul>
			<li>Any of Valve's cubes (Standard/Antique, Companion, Sphere, Reflective, Frankencube).</li>
			<!--<li>Sphere Cannons</li>
			<li>Bumbleballs</li>
			<li>Catapult Cubes</li>-->
			</ul>
		</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Portalable Stairs:</dt>
		<dd>Like the normal stairs, but portalable. Note that they are not intended to be portalable when up (too small), only when retracted. Old Aperture &amp; Portal 1 styles angle these surfaces differently, extending them straight out instead of angling them.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Portalable Piston Platform:</dt>
		<dd>A portable piston platform. This platform crushes players slightly slower than normal to allow you to portal through a auto-triggering platform. Portals will fizzle whenever the platform moves.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Recessed Fizzler, Paint Fizzler, Laserfield:</dt>
		<dd>A panel recessed into the wall with a fizzler covering it. Accepts inputs like normal. Weighted is a Discouragement Field, Cube is a Emancipation Grill and Sphere is a Paint Fizzler.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Sideways Hard Light Bridge:</dt>
		<dd>A sideways Hard Light Bridge that emits parallel to the surface it is placed on. It takes up the half of the surface in the direction of the rotation handle.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Rotating Faith Plate:</dt>
		<dd>A Faith Plate on a rotating platform which can switch between two targets. Place part 1 down and aim it at the target for the off position. Put part 2 down on the same block and aim it at a the target for the on position. Wire inputs into part 1 to make it switch. You can freely adjust trajectories like the normal plates. Don't set either to aim straight up, this will have incorrect animations.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Piston Relay:</dt>
		<dd>A Laser Relay mounted on top of a Piston Platform. The Relay will align to normal ones in any of its positions. The glass platform has been removed, leaving no standing space (except on top of the relay itself). Do not place this item in goo (any part), the relay will be destroyed by it.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Slow Crusher:</dt>
		<dd>A version of the normal crusher which slowly extends when enabled, like in some coop maps. It is safe when fully extended or retracted, and does not oscillate. Players and objects are not able to fit through the gap between the pistons.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Half Glass Door:</dt>
		<dd>Four glass panel arms that form a door, like in coop maps. They occupy space both below and above the door, but only take up half of the block in the facing direction. Place on the ceiling to improve the antline wiring, and add antline routers or light strips on the sides if necessary.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Clamped Cube:</dt>
		<dd>A cube held in place by a claw on a piston. When the input is triggered, the cube will be released as the piston retracts into the wall. The hole will then be closed over. Cannot be placed on the floor. The claw is always positioned horizontally. Reflection cubes can still be used while held. This works very well with a Global Cube Dropper to allow the cube to be replaced if destroyed.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Chamberlock:</dt>
		<dd>An exit door combined with a fizzler and some triggers, so it will lock closed after the player walks through. This will trigger its output permanently when the door closes, as well as autosave. The second door will fizzle items if they are between it, so it cannot be obstructed. The trigger shown in the editor model will lock the doors approximately when the player gets to the edge of it.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Retractable Floor Button:</dt>
		<dd>A slightly recessed floor button covered by two angled panels. It cannot be pushed when the panels are closed, which will dissolve cubes left under them when retracting. All three button types are available, and the item takes up 2 blocks centred over 3 blocks. This is done to allow the button to align to the grid like normal buttons, and permit interaction with things like funnels or lasers.</dd>
		</dl>	
		
		<!-- - - - INPUTS - - - -->	
		<h2 id="input">Multi-input</h2>
		<p>These items have two separate inputs like the Excursion Funnel. Due to a limitation in the PTI these inputs must be converted using some special logic before reaching the item to allow the inputs to stay separate.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Input A and Input B:</dt>
		<dd>The Input A/B items convert inputs so they work separately to the other input. Place both in the map and wire them both to a dual-input item. Wire normal inputs into Input A/B to control those parts of the dual-input item. These don't work with the excursion funnel. These are combined with the SR latch as one item type to make it easier to switch between them. One Input A/B item can be connected to multiple targets, as long as each target has only a maximum of one input A and one input B item connected to it. You don't need to place an Input A/B item if it won't have any inputs to it.</dd>
		
		<dt>S/R (Set/Reset) Latch:</dt>
		<dd>A logic item which memorises its current state. When Input A turns on it is "set" to an enabled state. When Input B turns on the latch is "Reset" to a disabled state. If both inputs are on, the latch will prefer the most recently activated input. The Start Enabled option controls whether it begins enabled or not.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Angled panel with Hard Light Bridge:</dt>
		<dd>A Hard Light Bridge mounted on an angled panel, to allow them to change their angle during a chamber. Input A and the "Start Enabled" property control the bridge; Input B and the "Start Open" property control the panel arm. The panel is always non-portalable, and in some styles may be completely absent. Set "Start Reversed" to switch the bridge to a vertical orientation, instead of a horizontal one.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Piston Autoportal:</dt>
		<dd>A piston platform combined with a orange auto-portal emitter. The portal will close when moving, but reopen when stopped. Input A controls the portal and Input B controls the piston. It does not automatically move when not given inputs.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Override:</dt>
		<dd>When Input B is off, this functions as an AND gate using Input A. When Input B is enabled, however the AND gate is overridden, changing the output to the state of the Start Reversed property until it turns off again. Start Enabled inverts the AND gate. This is very useful to lock doors behind players or reopen them again after the original inputs have deactivated.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<!-- - - - LOGIC - - - -->
		
		<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
		<p>Invisible, non-colliding items that affect the map in more technical ways.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Music:</dt>
			<dd>Invisible items controlling the in-game music.
		<ul>
			<li>Weighted is a laser music controller. Wire in up to 3 laser catchers or relays to have it emit dynamic music when they are powered.</li>
			<li>Cube is a music chooser for the background music. Set the timer to 3-9 to choose the track. Infinite turns off the music completely. It selects from the seven PTI music tracks. </li>
			<li>Sphere is the same, but lets you choose from a list of music tracks fitting the style.</li>
		</ul>
		   Only have one music chooser, you can have any number of laser controllers. When a music chooser has been placed in the map, it will also add faith-plate music.<br>

		<dd>This item prevents antlines from running on the face it is placed on. This item should be free in respect to the entity count.</dd>
		
		<dt>Antline Magnet:</dt>
		<dd>Forces antlines to meet here. Up to four checkmark boxes from inputs will appear on the selected side. Turn off antlines for the target object to ensure the inputs are displayed correctly.

		<!-- - - - STATIC - - - -->
		<h2 id="static">Static Items</h2>
		These items are more static compared to most. They are very cheap, do not move and form the geometry of the chamber, much like glass.
		<dl>
		<dt>Ditch:</dt>
		<dd>A small ditch in the floor to hold spheres for you. Don't use the angled sides as part of a puzzle, Portal 1 and Art Therapy use a square ditch instead of the angled depression.</dd>

		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Thin Wall, Black and White:</dt>

		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Angled Block:</dt>
		<dd>An angled surface that extends to both sides of a block. White and black versions available. The 60 and 30 degree blocks are designed to be used together to form one continuous surface. Note: in some styles (Ratman/Wheatley) not all sides will be a full surface. The top side will always be the same, but the triangular sides may be replaced with grating.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Wall Feature:</dt>
		<dd>A set of 6 "set pieces" that can be used to spice up wall sections. They are chosen based on the button type and portalability of the surface. They mainly fill inside walls. All styles have their own version of this. When placed on portalable surfaces, the items will have white textures to fit in but will never be portalable. Different items may or may not be affected by gels.<br>
			Types:<dl>
				<dt>Clean:</dt>
				<dd>Black uses various mixed size black tiles.</dd>
				<dd>White uses both colours in these patterns. White set to sphere has a camera in the centre.</dd>
				
				<dt>Old Aperture:</dt>
				<dd>Black is a open frame showing air vents, motors and piping.</dd>
				<dd>White is varied: a boarded-over white wall, a wall with a loudspeaker and a wall featuring a number of signs.</dd>
				
				<dt>Portal 1:</dt>
				<dd>Black is a few mixed-size Portal 1 black tiles, similar to clean style.</dd>
				<dd>White is varied: a piston holding a small section of wall and two different mixed tile combinations.</dd>
				
				<dt>Art Therapy:</dt>
				<dd>Art Therapy uses similar panels to clean style, but with the addition of missing tiles and grating showing skybox.</dd>
				
				<dt>Ratman:</dt>
				<dd>Black uses different damaged wall tiles as well as malfunctioning panel arms.</dd>
				<dd>White is a few walls with many missing tiles.</dd>
				
				<dt>Refurbished:</dt>

		<dt>Static Piston Platform:</dt>
		<dd>Cheaper version of the piston platform that never moves. Drag the platform up and down to set the position. It will use glass panels normally, check "Start Enabled" to add a black panel to the top, and check "Start Reversed" to make this panel portalable. Different styles will use appropriate pistons or other supports (Old Aperture uses a tower of metal truss).</dd>

		<dt>Static Angled Panel:</dt>
		<dd>A version of the standard angled panel that fits styles much better. This item gives only 30&deg;, 45&deg; and 60&deg; angles. (90&deg; could be made using thin walls). These panels will match the portalability of the attached surface. Portal 1 style will use accurate pistons, Old Aperture style uses wood panels held by small poles. Clean, Ratman, Art Therapy and Wheatley style look the same as the normal item.</dd>

		<dt>Crusher Plate:</dt>
		<dd>A large plate with holes that crusher spikes fit nicely into. Place on walls and floors opposite crushers to make the map look nicer.</dd>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dt>Static Glass Panel:</dt>
		<dd>Similar to the static angled panel, it is a replica of the normal glass panels but is cheaper, never moves and therefore fits styles much better. Clean and Art Therapy use normal glass panel arms, Portal 1 and Old Aperture style use framed sheets of glass held up by small supports and Ratman style has shattered glass panels on rusty arms.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<hr >
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Static Half Panel:</dt>
		<dd>A version of the angled panel that only extends half a block out. It takes up a 1/2 x 1/2 x 1 area. The top of the panel matches the portalability of the anchor surface. Ratman style has panel arms that extend up when the player enters the map.</dd>

		<dl>
		<dt>Glass with Hole:</dt>
		<dd>A panel of glass with a small hole in the centre. Placed like normal glass and functions similarly to grating. It can be extended over multiple blocks, but all sections will have frames on the side and a hole in the centre. In some styles, the hole is square or a different shape, but this is purely cosmetic.</dd>

		<dt>Ceiling Light:</dt>
		<dd>An item that can be placed on the ceiling to provide large amounts of light, as well as make it look more interesting. Only place one of these at a time. When placed it will disable fancy lighting effects on the large observation room so it can use the effect. The direction that it is facing will be the direction the light casts in. <br>
			Variants:<dl>
			<dt>Clean:</dt> <dd>Five large lighting panels.</dd>
			<dt>Portal 1:</dt><dd>A black tiled roof with one large and two small holes that have a white glow behind them.</dd>
			<dt>Ratman:</dt> <dd>A collapsed section of black ceiling through which sunlight streams through.</dd>
			<dt>Overgrown Style</dt><dd>A collapsed ceiling section, overgrown with plants. Sunlight also streams through it.</dd>
			<dt>1950s:</dt>	<dd>A hole in the roof with many lights shining down. They are covered by a grating.</dd>
			<dt>1970s:</dt> <dd>Some of the lights are now missing, and they are mounted off-centre. The grating has been replaced with some support frames.</dd>
			<dt>1980s:</dt> <dd>The lights are now more modern. The frames are a different style, with most missing.</dd>
			<dt>Art Therapy:</dt> <dd>Appears similar to 1950s style, with off-centre lights and a full grating covering them.</dd>
