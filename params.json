{"name":"tSpenAddons","tagline":"Items and Styles for the BEE2","body":"TeamSpen210's BEE 2 Addons\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nMy collection of Items and Styles for the BEE2. All non-logic items are fully styled for all the default styles. It is compatible with Radelite's addons, providing styled versions for the Ratman Style. \r\n\r\nThis includes my Refurbished Style, a hybrid of Clean and 1950s style similar to the Coop Course 5. I also have a modified version of 1980s style, with a damaged Enrichment Sphere showing the surrounding Test Shaft. I now have an Overgrown Style, replicating the dilapidated Aperture seen in the first few levels of the singleplayer campaign. There is also a debug Unlocked style to allow adding or deleting the mandatory entry/exits and observation rooms. Be careful with this!\r\n\r\nThanks to Skotty (High Energy Pellets, Bumbleballs and Catapult Cubes), Moth(Bumbleballs), SoundLogic(Catapult Cubes) and PortalCombat (Sphere Cannon) for creating the original versions of some items, which I have made PTI compatible and restyled.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[Download Here!](http://forums.thinkingwithportals.com/downloads.php?view=detail&df_id=2833)\r\n================\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
