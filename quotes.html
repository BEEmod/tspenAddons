	<h2><a id="method">Selection method</a></h2>
	<p>Quotes are chosen using a priority system based on items in the map. Most items have a category, and some apply to two categories - for example, laserfields apply to the Deadly category as well as the Laser category. The categories have a specific priority sequence. The first category found that has an item that exists in the map will have its lines chosen, stopping other categories from playing. Some additional lines are played outside of this, based on other events occurring (usually only the first time). </p>
	<p>Sometimes there are multiple line sequences to choose from in one category, which are selected based upon which entry/exit corridor is selected (7 SP entry, 4 exits, 1 Coop entry). This is chosen randomly by the PTI whenever a map is created, and doesn't change after that making it useful for this purpose. </p> 
	<p>In each table, the categories are ordered from highest to lowest. Click on a voice line to hear it (via the <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Voice_lines">Portal Wiki</a>), or hover over to get a transcript. The heading before the colon says when it is triggered, and each indented line after plays as a group. if there are two or more colon-headings the same but ending with numbers, one will be randomly chosen to play.</p>

	<p>Refurbished style is unique in that it has two quote characters, <span class=cav>Cave</span> and <span class=gla>GLaDOS</span> (plus the PTI dialogue). GLaDOS's line plays as you drop into the enrichment sphere, PTI dialogue starts once you touch the ground and Cave plays lines when you enter the chamber. In Coop they play in the same order, but GLaDOS and the PTI dialogue plays after the map starts. GLaDOS and Cave's lines do not obstruct each other, unless there is a sequence with both (IE. they only speak once on entry, excluding PTI dialogue and GLaDOS's intro dialogue.) GLaDOS uses the intercom dings to distinguish her lines more.
